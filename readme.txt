When registering to a new online service, you might go through the hassle of filling the registration form, only to discover
that the username you chose has already been taking. And this is where AJAX comes into play.
AJAX means Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It is a logical means of running asyn tasks in the background. With this 
functionality integrated with the registration form, users, can know immediately if the username they chose has been 
picked by someone else.
